# EnTT in Action

`EnTT` is widely used in private and commercial applications. I cannot even
mention most of them because of some signatures I put on some documents time
ago. Fortunately, there are also people who took the time to implement open
source projects based on `EnTT` and did not hold back when it came to
documenting them.

Below an incomplete list of games, applications and articles that can be used as
a reference:

* Games

    Minecraft, by Mojang (see the open source attributions page).

    a game to play with your face.

    to make Pacman with `EnTT`.

    of use of `EnTT` from which to take inspiration if interested.

If you know of other resources out there that are about `EnTT`, feel free to
open an issue or a PR and I'll be glad to add them to this page.
