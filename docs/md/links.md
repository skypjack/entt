# Introduction

`EnTT` is widely used in private and commercial applications. I cannot even
mention most of them because of some signatures I put on some documents time
ago. Fortunately, there are also people who took the time to implement open
source projects based on `EnTT` and didn't hold back when it came to documenting
them.

Below an incomplete list of games, applications and articles that can be used as
a reference.<br/>
Where I put the word _apparently_ means that the use of `EnTT` is documented but
the authors didn't make explicit announcements or contacted me directly.

If you know of other resources out there that are about `EnTT`, feel free to
open an issue or a PR and I'll be glad to add them to this page.<br/>
I hope the following lists can grow much more in the future.
