# EnTT in Action

`EnTT` is widely used in private and commercial applications. I cannot even
mention most of them because of some signatures I put on some documents time
ago. Fortunately, there are also people who took the time to implement open
source projects based on `EnTT` and didn't hold back when it came to documenting
them.

Below an incomplete list of games, applications and articles that can be used as
a reference. Where I put the word _apparently_ means that the use of `EnTT` is
documented but the authors didn't make explicit announcements or contacted me
directly.

I hope this list can grow much more in the future:
