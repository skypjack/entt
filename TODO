we can get rid of the available vector and use an entt_traits::entity_type element and a boolean in place of it.
the idea is to create an implicit next-list in the entt_traits::entity_mask part of an entity, so that it doesn't affect the version.
the each member function can the iterate all the entities and check if the mask return the entity position to test for validity.
in all the other cases (mask different from the position or mask equal to the available start point) the entity isn't valid.
it sounds good indeed, experimental feature to be tested.
