* long term feature: shared_ptr less locator and resource cache
* debugging tools (#60): the issue online already contains interesting tips on this, look at it
* work stealing job system (see #100) + mt scheduler based on const awareness for types
* add examples (and credits) from @alanjfs :)
* custom pools example (multi instance, tables, enable/disable, and so on...)

WIP:
* runtime components (registry), runtime events (dispatcher/emitter), ...
* single prop call with operator() for meta factories (to cut down instantiations)
* remove the tombstone check (version check + null version)
* dedicated entity storage, in-place O(1) release/destroy
* general purpose paged vector container
* custom allocators all over

WIP:
* payload tracking destroy mixin for pools
* make sparse_set/storage adhere to AllocatorAwareContainer requirements
* make it possible to register externally managed pools with the registry (allow for system centric mode)
* registry: switch to the udata/mixin model and get rid of poly storage, use pointer to sparse set only for pools, discard pool_data type.
* make pools available (registry/view/group), review operator| for views
* resource, forward the id to the loader from the cache and if constexpr the call to load, update doc and describe customization points
* make it possible to create views of the type `view<T, T>`, add get by index and such, allow to register custom pools by name with the registry
* add user data to type_info
* any_vector for context variables
* make const registry::view thread safe, switch to a view<T...>{registry} model (long term goal)
* weak reference wrapper example with custom storage
* headless (sparse set only) view
* write documentation for custom storages and views!!
* make runtime views use opaque storage and therefore return also elements.
* add exclude-only views to combine with packs
* entity-aware observer, add observer functions aside observer class
* deprecate non-owning groups in favor of owning views and view packs, introduce lazy owning views
* snapshot: support for range-based archives
* add example: 64 bit ids with 32 bits reserved for users' purposes
