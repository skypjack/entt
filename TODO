* filtered each (apply a filter to the entities before to return them, it helps separating checks from logic)
* custom allocators and EnTT allocator-aware in general (long term feature, I don't actually need it at the moment) - see #22
* to analyze, long term feature: systems organizer based on dependency graphs for implicit parallelism (I don't want to think anymore in future :-))
* save/restore functionalities - see #27
* parent-child relationships between entities directly managed by the registry. is it possible to do that in a clean and safe way?
* scene management (I prefer the concept of spaces, that is a kind of scene anyway)
* blueprint registry - kind of factory to create entitites template for initialization (get rid of the extra versions of Registry::create)
* review doc: separate it in multiple md/dox files, reduce the readme to a minimum and provide users with links to the online documentation on gh-pages
* AOB
