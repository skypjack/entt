/**
 * @brief Base class for processes.
 *
 * This class stays true to the CRTP idiom. Derived classes must specify what's
 * the intended type for elapsed times.<br/>
 * A process should expose publicly the following member functions whether
 * required:
 *
 * * @code{.cpp}
 *   void update(Delta, void *);
 *   @endcode
 *
 *   It's invoked once per tick until a process is explicitly aborted or it
 *   terminates either with or without errors. Even though it's not mandatory to
 *   declare this member function, as a rule of thumb each process should at
 *   least define it to work properly. The `void *` parameter is an opaque
 *   pointer to user data (if any) forwarded directly to the process during an
 *   update.
 *
 * * @code{.cpp}
 *   void init();
 *   @endcode
 *
 *   It's invoked when the process joins the running queue of a scheduler. This
 *   happens as soon as it's attached to the scheduler if the process is a top
 *   level one, otherwise when it replaces its parent if the process is a
 *   continuation.
 *
 * * @code{.cpp}
 *   void succeeded();
 *   @endcode
 *
 *   It's invoked in case of success, immediately after an update and during the
 *   same tick.
 *
 * * @code{.cpp}
 *   void failed();
 *   @endcode
 *
 *   It's invoked in case of errors, immediately after an update and during the
 *   same tick.
 *
 * * @code{.cpp}
 *   void aborted();
 *   @endcode
 *
 *   It's invoked only if a process is explicitly aborted. There is no guarantee
 *   that it executes in the same tick, this depends solely on whether the
 *   process is aborted immediately or not.
 *
 * Derived classes can change the internal state of a process by invoking the
 * `succeed` and `fail` protected member functions and even pause or unpause the
 * process itself.
 *
 * @sa scheduler
 *
 * @tparam Derived Actual type of process that extends the class template.
 * @tparam Delta Type to use to provide elapsed time.
