 * @brief Prototype container for _concepts_.
 *
 * A prototype is used to define a _concept_ in terms of components.<br/>
 * Prototypes act as templates for those specific types of an application which
 * users would otherwise define through a series of component assignments to
 * entities. In other words, prototypes can be used to assign components to
 * entities of a registry at once.
 *
 * @note
 * Components used along with prototypes must be copy constructible. Prototypes
 * wrap component types with custom types, so they do not interfere with other
 * users of the registry they were built with.
 *
 * @warning
 * Prototypes directly use their underlying registries to store entities and
 * components for their purposes. Users must ensure that the lifetime of a
 * registry and its contents exceed that of the prototypes that use it.
 *
 * @tparam Entity A valid entity type (see entt_traits for more details).
