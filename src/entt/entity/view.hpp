/**
 * @brief Persistent view.
 *
 * A persistent view returns all the entities and only the entities that have
 * at least the given components. Moreover, it's guaranteed that the entity list
 * is tightly packed in memory for fast iterations.<br/>
 * In general, persistent views don't stay true to the order of any set of
 * components unless users explicitly sort them.
 *
 * @b Important
 *
 * Iterators aren't invalidated if:
 *
 * * New instances of the given components are created and assigned to entities.
 * * The entity currently pointed is modified (as an example, if one of the
 *   given components is removed from the entity to which the iterator points).
 *
 * In all the other cases, modifying the pools of the given components in any
 * way invalidates all the iterators and using them results in undefined
 * behavior.
 *
 * @note
 * Views share references to the underlying data structures with the Registry
 * that generated them. Therefore any change to the entities and to the
 * components made by means of the registry are immediately reflected by
 * views.<br/>
 * Moreover, sorting a persistent view affects all the other views of the same
 * type (it means that users don't have to call `sort` on each view to sort all
 * of them because they share the set of entities).
 *
 * @warning
 * Lifetime of a view must overcome the one of the registry that generated it.
 * In any other case, attempting to use a view results in undefined behavior.
 *

 * underlying data structures. See SparseSet and its specializations for more
 * details.
 *
 * @b Important

 * * New instances of the given components are created and assigned to entities.
 * * The entity currently pointed is modified (as an example, if one of the
 *   given components is removed from the entity to which the iterator points).
 *
 * In all the other cases, modifying the pools of the given components in any
 * way invalidates all the iterators and using them results in undefined
 * behavior.
 *
 * @note
 * Views share references to the underlying data structures with the Registry
 * that generated them. Therefore any change to the entities and to the
 * components made by means of the registry are immediately reflected by views,
 * unless a pool wasn't missing when the view was built (in this case, the view
 * won't have a valid reference and won't be updated accordingly).
