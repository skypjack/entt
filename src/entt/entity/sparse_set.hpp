/**
 * @brief Basic sparse set implementation.
 *
 * Sparse set or packed array or whatever is the name users give it.<br/>
 * Two arrays: an _external_ one and an _internal_ one; a _sparse_ one and a
 * _packed_ one; one used for direct access through contiguous memory, the other
 * one used to get the data through an extra level of indirection.<br/>
 * This is largely used by the Registry to offer users the fastest access ever
 * to the components. View and PersistentView are entirely designed around
 * sparse sets.
 *
 * This type of data structure is widely documented in the literature and on the
 * web. This is nothing more than a customized implementation suitable for the
 * purpose of the framework.
 *
 * @note
 * There are no guarantees that entities are returned in the insertion order
 * when iterate a sparse set. Do not make assumption on the order in any case.
 *
 * @note
 * Internal data structures arrange elements to maximize performance. Because of
 * that, there are no guarantees that elements have the expected order when
 * iterate directly the internal packed array (see `data` and `size` member
 * functions for that). Use `begin` and `end` instead.
 *
 * @tparam Entity A valid entity type (see entt_traits for more details).
